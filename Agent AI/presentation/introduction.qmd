# Introduction

## Reinforcement Learning

![](images/reinforcement_learning.png)

. . .

- An agent learns to optimize a specified target through trial and error interactions with the environment

. . .

- Traditional RL methods struggle with high-dimensional state spaces and complex environments

. . .

- Integration of deep learning techniques with RL has led to significant breakthroughs

## Large Language Models

- LLMs typically refer to the Transformer-based language models containing hundreds of billions of parameters

. . .

- They tend to exhibit emergent abilities that are not present in small models

    - In-context learning

        - Task-related texts are included in the prompts as context information

    - Instruction following

        - Diverse task-specific datasets formatted with natural language descriptions

    - Step-by-step reasoning

        - Chain of Thought

        - Tree of Thought

        - Graph of Thought 

## LLM-enhanced Reinforcement Learning
